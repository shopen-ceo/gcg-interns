# Using npm

This example demonstrates how to use an external package from npm.

## Steps to run this example:

1.  **Open your terminal** in this directory (`04-nodejs/03-npm`).

2.  **Install the dependencies** by running the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This will download the `express` package and create a `node_modules` directory.

3.  **Start the server** by running the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message "Hello, Express!".
